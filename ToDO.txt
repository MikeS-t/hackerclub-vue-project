1. Error Msg System... where element inside App.vue will watch for error msg commitment from the store
with any kinds of store related errors. With a hand written title to point to what part of the project
the error is connected to. The element will be "sniptool"? (i already have some so it will be easy to find)
and it will stay there untill the btn close is pressed.

X2. Games Order (position they are standing when page is oppend) something with self ordered list (research
how that works) if not newest game goest first and thats it.

X3. File drag long range detection for the custom file upload component. 3 stages: very long - dropzone is gray
mid - dropzone is orage (footer color) and file in the dropzone red as it is now.
And maybe some animation/image for inside.

4. Transition for chaning backraunds on games.vue

5. Gradients for the cards (if possible)

6. Game tags in edit menu with colors and selected + adding extra tag option. That can be done with seperate
array of key tag pairs.

7. Use the snackbar component everywhere where i use snackbar!

8. Nice animation for init loading
